# Location Identifier

## 📌 Introduction
**Location Identifier** is our **second learning project for the university**, designed to extract **location names** from user-input sentences. Built using **Python (Streamlit)**, this project efficiently detects place names, even with **spelling mistakes or variations**, and returns them as output.

This project was developed by:
- **Aman (Team Lead)**
- **Sameer Singh**
- **Vishal Hembram**

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Location Identifier** is an advanced **natural language processing (NLP) application** that extracts place names from text. The core features include:

### 🔹 Key Features:
1. **🌍 Location Name Extraction:**
   - Users can enter a **sentence**, and the system will extract **location names** from it.
   
2. **🛠️ Intelligent Algorithm:**
   - Optimized to **retrieve names quickly**.
   - Handles **spelling mistakes** and **spelling variations** to some extent.

3. **📄 Cleaned and Optimized Dataset:**
   - The **CSV file dataset** was manually cleaned to ensure accurate detection.
   - Improved efficiency in name retrieval by **removing inconsistencies and redundant data**.
